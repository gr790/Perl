*** You have extra Perl library paths set in your environment.
    Please note that these paths (set with PERL5LIB or PERLLIB)
    are not honored by perl when running under taint mode, which
    may lead to problems. This is a limitation (by design) of
    Perl, not of PAR::Packer; but some of the problems may
    manifest here during installation.
Checking if your kit is complete...
